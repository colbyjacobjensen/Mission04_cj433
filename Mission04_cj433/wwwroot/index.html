        <p>
            There is a lot I hope to get out of IS 413.  My first priority is to love C#.  I know that it will be a steep climb, but the reward will be worth it.
            I also want to be more comfortable coding.  Coding is a foreign language to me, but I am hoping this immersion program will be well worth it.  I excpect to be dreaming in C#.
