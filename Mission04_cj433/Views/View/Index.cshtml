<h3>IS 413 Goals:</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        There is a lot I hope to get out of IS 413.  My first priority is to love C#.  I know that it will be a steep climb, but the reward will be worth it.
        I also want to be more comfortable coding.  Coding is a foreign language to me, but I am hoping this immersion program will be well worth it.  I expect to be dreaming in C#.
